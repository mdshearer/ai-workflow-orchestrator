# Mapping Your Domain to Adaptive Cycles

**A practical guide to mapping your work to the r→K→Ω→α framework**

---

## Overview

This guide helps you map your specific domain (content writing, software development, design, research, etc.) to the four phases of the adaptive cycle. By the end, you'll understand:

- Which activities belong in which phase
- When phase transitions occur
- How to structure your workflow around natural breakpoints

---

## Quick Reference: The Four Phases

| Phase | Mindset | Speed | Focus | Example Activities |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **r** (Growth) | Exploratory | Fast | Breadth | Strategy, research, brainstorming |
| **K** (Conservation) | Productive | Slow | Depth | Building, refining, optimizing |
| **Ω** (Release) | Critical | Fast | Quality | Evaluation, scoring, gatekeeping |
| **α** (Reorganization) | Strategic | Fast | Learning | Retrospectives, system updates |

---

## Mapping Exercise

### Step 1: List Your Activities (5 minutes)

Write down every major activity in your workflow, in order.

**Example: Content Writing**
```
- Brainstorm topic ideas
- Research audience
- Define content angle
- Gather facts and sources
- Create article outline
- Write first draft
- Edit for voice and clarity
- Check facts and citations
- Review for publication
- Learn from reader feedback
```

**Example: Software Development**
```
- Gather requirements
- Research technical approaches
- Design architecture
- Write code
- Run unit tests
- Code review
- Integration testing
- Deploy to production
- Monitor performance
- Retrospective on issues
```

**Your turn - list your activities:**
```
1. ___________________________
2. ___________________________
3. ___________________________
4. ___________________________
5. ___________________________
6. ___________________________
7. ___________________________
8. ___________________________
```

---

### Step 2: Classify Each Activity (10 minutes)

For each activity, ask these diagnostic questions:

#### Diagnostic Question 1: Exploration vs. Production vs. Evaluation vs. Meta

**Is this activity:**
- **Exploring possibilities** (many options, uncertain outcome) → r-phase
- **Building something** (executing a plan) → K-phase
- **Evaluating quality** (judging if it's good enough) → Ω-phase
- **Improving the system** (updating processes/rules) → α-phase

#### Diagnostic Question 2: Divergent vs. Convergent

**Is thinking:**
- **Divergent** (broadening, many paths) → r-phase
- **Convergent** (narrowing, single path) → K-phase
- **Neither** (evaluating existing work) → Ω-phase
- **Meta** (thinking about thinking) → α-phase

#### Diagnostic Question 3: Creative vs. Critical

**Is the mindset:**
- **Creative** (generating, building) → r or K-phase
- **Critical** (judging, evaluating) → Ω-phase
- **Reflective** (learning, improving) → α-phase

---

### Step 3: Assign to Phases

Map each activity to a phase using the decision tree:

```
Start with activity
  ↓
Is this improving the system itself (not the work product)?
  YES → α-phase (Reorganization)
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is this evaluating/critiquing completed work?
  YES → Ω-phase (Release)
  NO → Continue
  ↓
Is this exploring options OR building/refining?
  Exploring → r-phase (Growth)
  Building → K-phase (Conservation)
```

**Example: Content Writing (mapped)**

| Activity | Phase | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Brainstorm topic ideas | r | Divergent exploration |
| Research audience | r | Gathering information |
| Define content angle | r | Strategic planning |
| Gather facts and sources | r | Resource collection |
| Create article outline | K | Convergent structure |
| Write first draft | K | Production |
| Edit for voice and clarity | K | Refinement |
| Check facts and citations | K | Validation |
| Review for publication | Ω | Quality evaluation |
| Learn from reader feedback | α | System improvement |

**Example: Software Development (mapped)**

| Activity | Phase | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Gather requirements | r | Exploration and discovery |
| Research technical approaches | r | Option exploration |
| Design architecture | K | Convergent design |
| Write code | K | Production |
| Run unit tests | K | Validation (part of production) |
| Code review | Ω | Quality gate |
| Integration testing | Ω | System-level evaluation |
| Deploy to production | K | Final production step |
| Monitor performance | Ω | Ongoing evaluation |
| Retrospective on issues | α | System learning |

---

### Step 4: Identify Phase Transitions (10 minutes)

Phase transitions happen when your **mindset fundamentally shifts**.

#### r→K Transition: From Exploration to Production

**When does this happen?**
- Strategy is approved
- Research is complete
- Requirements are clear
- Plan is locked in

**Examples:**
- **Content:** Content brief approved → Start outlining
- **Software:** Requirements finalized → Start architecture
- **Design:** User research complete → Start sketching

**What changes:**
- Uncertainty → Clarity
- Many options → One path
- Divergent → Convergent

---

#### K→Ω Transition: From Production to Critique

**When does this happen?**
- Work product is complete
- Ready for evaluation
- Time for quality check
- Submission for review

**Examples:**
- **Content:** Draft complete → Critical review
- **Software:** Code complete → Code review
- **Design:** Prototype complete → Usability testing

**What changes:**
- Builder mindset → Judge mindset
- Friendly → Adversarial
- Creating → Evaluating

---

#### Ω→α Transition: From Critique to Evolution (CONDITIONAL)

**When does this happen?**
- Critical failure detected
- Score below threshold (e.g., <50/100)
- Recurring pattern (3rd occurrence of same issue)
- Systemic problem identified

**Examples:**
- **Content:** Blog post scores 42/100 → Root cause analysis
- **Software:** Security audit fails → Update security standards
- **Design:** Usability test fails badly → Revise design system

**What changes:**
- "What's wrong with THIS?" → "What's wrong with OUR SYSTEM?"
- Tactical fixes → Strategic improvements
- Product-focused → Process-focused

**IMPORTANT:** This transition is **conditional** - it doesn't happen on every project, only when significant failures occur.

---

#### α→r Transition: From Evolution to Next Cycle

**When does this happen?**
- System learnings captured
- Constitution/standards updated
- Root causes addressed
- Next cycle strategy defined

**Examples:**
- **Content:** Style guide updated → Next article uses new rules
- **Software:** Coding standards improved → Next feature follows them
- **Design:** Design patterns documented → Next project benefits

**What changes:**
- System is smarter
- Recurring mistakes prevented
- Process evolved

---

### Step 5: Visualize Your Flow

Draw your workflow with phase boundaries marked:

**Example: Content Writing**

└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ├─ Score ≥ 85 → ✅ Publish

             ├─ Score 50-69 → ⚠️ Back to Outline
             └─ Score < 50 → 🔥 Go to α-phase
                              │
                              ▼
             ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
             │   α-PHASE (Evolution)               │
             │                                     │
             │   Analyze → Update rules → Retry   │
             └────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          └─ Back to r-phase (Cycle N+1)
```

## Common Patterns Across Domains

### Front Loop (r→K): 80-90% of time
**Slow, predictable, capital-building**

All domains follow this pattern:
1. **r-phase:** Explore and gather (strategy, research, planning)
2. **K-phase:** Build and refine (production, optimization)

### Back Loop (Ω→α): 10-20% of time
**Fast, unpredictable, renewal**

Triggered on failure or completion:
1. **Ω-phase:** Evaluate and judge (critique, testing)
2. **α-phase:** Learn and evolve (only on significant failures)

---

## Validation Checklist

Use this to validate your mapping:

### Phase Coverage
- [ ] At least one r-phase activity (exploration)
- [ ] At least one K-phase activity (production)
- [ ] At least one Ω-phase activity (evaluation)
- [ ] At least one α-phase activity (learning)

### Transitions
- [ ] r→K trigger is clear (when does production start?)
- [ ] K→Ω trigger is clear (when is work ready for evaluation?)
- [ ] Ω→α trigger is conditional (only on failure/pattern)
- [ ] α→r trigger is clear (when does next cycle start?)

### Flow Logic
- [ ] Can't skip r-phase (no strategy = chaos)
- [ ] Can't skip K-phase (no production = no output)
- [ ] Can't skip Ω-phase (no evaluation = ship garbage)
- [ ] α-phase is optional (only when learning is needed)

---

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Everything in K-phase
**Problem:** No exploration, evaluation, or learning
**Fix:** Separate strategy (r) and critique (Ω) from production

### ❌ No Ω-phase
**Problem:** No quality gate
**Fix:** Add explicit evaluation step before shipping

### ❌ Permanent α-phase
**Problem:** Always retrospecting, never shipping
**Fix:** Make α conditional on failures only

### ❌ Skipping r-phase
**Problem:** Building without strategy leads to rework
**Fix:** Always start with strategy/research

## Next Steps

Once you've mapped your domain:

1. **Define personas** for each phase using [guides/defining-your-personas.md](./defining-your-personas.md)
2. **Create workflow** using [templates/workflows/workflow-template.yaml](../templates/workflows/workflow-template.yaml)
3. **Set up memory management** using [core/memory-system.md](../core/memory-system.md)
4. **Test with a real project**
