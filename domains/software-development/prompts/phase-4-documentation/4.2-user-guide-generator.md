# Customer Search Tool - User Guide

## What is this tool?

The Customer Search Tool helps you quickly find customer contact information and export it to use in other systems like Salesforce or Excel.

## How to Access

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
2. Go to: https://customers.internal.company.com
3. Log in with your company email and password

## How to Search for a Customer

### Step 1: Enter Search Terms
- Type the customer's name or company name in the search box at the top
- You don't need to type the full name - the tool will find partial matches
- Example: Typing "Acme" will find "Acme Corp", "Acme Industries", etc.

### Step 2: Click "Search"
- Click the blue "Search" button
- Results will appear below in a table
- Each row shows: Customer Name, Email, Phone, Company

### Step 3: Filter Results (Optional)
- Use the filters on the left side to narrow down your search:
  - Industry (e.g., Technology, Healthcare)
  - Region (e.g., North America, Europe)
  - Status (e.g., Active, Inactive)

## How to Export Customer Data

### Step 1: Perform Your Search
- Follow the steps above to search for customers

### Step 2: Click "Export to CSV"
- Click the green "Export to CSV" button at the top right
- A file will automatically download to your computer (usually to your Downloads folder)

### Step 3: Open the File
- Find the downloaded file (it will be named something like `customers_2025-11-14.csv`)
- Open it with Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets

**Note:** Exports are limited to 10,000 customers. If you need more, please contact IT.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I find a customer I know exists?**
A: Try using less specific search terms. For example, search "Smith" instead of "John Smith Corporation".

**Q: The "Export" button is grayed out. Why?**
A: You need to perform a search first. The export button will activate after you see search results.

**Q: How do I import the CSV file into Salesforce?**
A: See the Salesforce import guide on our wiki: [link to wiki]

**Q: Can I edit customer information in this tool?**
A: No, this tool is read-only. To update customer information, please contact the data team at data@company.com.

**Q: How often is the data updated?**
