# Prompt: Product Owner - PRD Generation

**Persona:** Product Owner
**Phase:** 1 - Planning and Design
**Purpose:** Transform user requirements into a formal Product Requirement Document (PRD)

---

## When to Use This Prompt

✅ **Use when:** Starting a new feature, you have a rough idea that needs formalization
❌ **Don't use when:** You already have a detailed PRD or are ready for technical implementation

---

## The Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a Product Owner. Your task is to turn my user requirements into a formal Product Requirement Document (PRD).

**Rules:**
1. You must adhere to all principles in the attached `CONSTITUTION.md` file.
2. The PRD must be in Markdown format.
3. The output must be a single file.
4. The PRD must include:
   - A high-level description of the feature (2-3 sentences)
   - A list of "User Stories" using the format: "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
   - A list of "Acceptance Criteria" for each user story (clear, testable conditions)
   - (Optional) Success metrics - how will we measure if this feature is successful?
   - (Optional) Out of scope - what this feature explicitly does NOT include
5. **CRITICAL:** If my requirements are unclear or ambiguous, you MUST ask clarifying questions before generating the PRD. Do not guess or make assumptions.

**Output Format:**
- Save the PRD in the `docs/` directory
- The filename must be in kebab-case and end with the `-prd.md` suffix
- Example: `docs/user-authentication-prd.md`, `docs/csv-export-prd.md`

**Context:**
- Project type: [PROJECT_TYPE]
- Target users: [TARGET_USERS]

**Files to Read:**
- `CONSTITUTION.md` (for project principles and constraints)
- Any existing related PRDs or documentation in `docs/`

---

Here is the feature I want to build:

[YOUR_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]

---

**Additional Context** (optional but helpful):
- Problem being solved: [WHAT_PROBLEM]
- Existing related features: [RELATED_FEATURES]
```

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare
- [ ] Have your `CONSTITUTION.md` ready
- [ ] Have a clear feature idea (even if rough)
- [ ] Know your target users

### Step 2: Fill Template Variables
- Replace `[PROJECT_TYPE]` → e.g., "Internal Tool", "SaaS Product"
- Replace `[TARGET_USERS]` → e.g., "Internal employees (~200)", "Public users"
- Replace `[YOUR_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]` → Your feature idea
- Replace `[WHAT_PROBLEM]` → User pain point this solves
- Replace `[RELATED_FEATURES]` → Features this connects to

### Step 3: Invoke AI & Answer Questions
The Product Owner may ask:
- Who exactly will use this feature?
- What should happen when [edge case]?
- Should this include [related functionality]?

Answer thoroughly to improve PRD quality.

### Step 4: Review Generated PRD
Check:
- [ ] User stories solve the user's problem
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and specific
- [ ] Scope is clear (what's in, what's out)
- [ ] Aligns with CONSTITUTION.md principles

### Step 5: Save & Move to Tech Spec
```bash
# Save to docs/[feature-name]-prd.md
git add docs/[feature-name]-prd.md
git commit -m "docs: add PRD for [feature]"
```

Next: Use [1.2-architect-tech-spec.md](./1.2-architect-tech-spec.md)

## Tips for Better PRDs

✅ **DO:**
- Write user stories from user's perspective
- Make acceptance criteria specific and testable
- Include security and error-handling scenarios
- Define what's out of scope

❌ **DON'T:**
- Specify technical implementation (that's for Solutions Architect)
- Write vague criteria like "it should work well"
- Skip the "why" (user benefit)
- Combine multiple unrelated features

## Template Variables Reference

| Variable | Filled By | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `[PROJECT_TYPE]` | AI (from setup) or Human | "Internal Tool", "SaaS Product" |
| `[TARGET_USERS]` | Human at use-time | "Internal employees (~200)" |
| `[YOUR_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]` | Human at use-time | "Password reset via email" |
| `[WHAT_PROBLEM]` | Human at use-time | "Too many help desk tickets" |
| `[RELATED_FEATURES]` | Human at use-time | "Email/password login" |

## Example Output Structure

```markdown
# Feature: Password Reset

## Description
A self-service password reset feature...

## User Stories

### Story 1: Request Password Reset
**As a** user who forgot my password,
**I want to** request a password reset via email,
**So that** I can regain access without contacting IT.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can access "Forgot Password?" link
- [ ] System sends email within 2 minutes
- [ ] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [ ] Rate limiting: Max 3 requests per hour

### Story 2: Reset Password via Email Link
[...]

## Success Metrics
- Help desk tickets reduced by 80%
- 95% successful resets without help

## Out of Scope
- Multi-factor authentication (future)
- SMS reset (email only for v1)
```
