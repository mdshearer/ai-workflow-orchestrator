# Prompt: Iterative Implementation (Task-by-Task Coding)

**Persona:** Specialist Developer
**Phase:** 2 - Implementation
**Purpose:** Implement one specific task from the task list

---

## When to Use This Prompt

✅ **Use when:** You have a task list and you're ready to implement one specific task
❌ **Don't use when:** You don't have a task list, or you want to implement multiple tasks at once

**Critical Rule:** ONE TASK AT A TIME. Never implement multiple tasks in a single prompt.

---

## The Prompt Template

```markdown
You are an expert **[LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]** developer.

**Your Context:**

1. **Constitution:** You MUST follow all rules in `CONSTITUTION.md`

2. **Task List:** We are working on **Task #[NUMBER]** from the task list

3. **Task Description:**
   [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

4. **Relevant Code:** Read the existing code you need to modify or reference from the codebase

**Your Assignment:**

1. Write the code to complete **ONLY** the task described above
2. Do NOT implement any other tasks from the list
3. Explain your code step-by-step, including **why** you made certain decisions
4. Include clear comments in the code as specified by CONSTITUTION.md
5. Handle errors properly (as specified in CONSTITUTION.md)
6. If the task requires creating a new file, provide the complete file
7. If the task requires modifying an existing file, show the exact changes

**Additional Requirements:**
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Adhere to naming conventions from CONSTITUTION.md
- Add meaningful comments (explain "why", not "what")
- Include error handling
- Do not use any prohibited technologies from CONSTITUTION.md

---

**Files to Read:**
- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `docs/[feature-name]-tasks.md` (for context)
- All relevant code files (existing code this task will touch)
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare
- [ ] Identify the next task from your task list
- [ ] Gather CONSTITUTION.md and relevant code files
- [ ] Copy the prompt template above

### Step 2: Fill Template Variables
- Replace `[LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]` → e.g., "Python/FastAPI", "TypeScript/React"
- Replace `[NUMBER]` → e.g., "5"
- Replace `[TASK_DESCRIPTION]` → Copy exact task text from your task list

### Step 3: Review Generated Code
Check for:
- [ ] Implements ONLY this task (not others)
- [ ] Follows CONSTITUTION.md standards
- [ ] Meaningful comments present
- [ ] Error handling included
- [ ] Matches existing patterns

### Step 4: Test & Commit
```bash
# Test the code
# Run linters/formatters
git add [files]
git commit -m "feat: [task description] (#[NUMBER])"
```

### Step 5: Repeat
Move to next task. Use this same prompt for Task #2, #3, etc.

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:** Implement multiple tasks at once
✅ **Do:** Complete one task, test it, then move to the next

❌ **Don't:** Deviate from the task description
✅ **Do:** Follow the tech spec exactly

❌ **Don't:** Write code without explanation
✅ **Do:** Explain step-by-step with reasoning

❌ **Don't:** Skip error handling
✅ **Do:** Add comprehensive error handling

❌ **Don't:** Use comments like `// Loop through users`
✅ **Do:** Use comments like `// Filter inactive users to reduce email volume`
