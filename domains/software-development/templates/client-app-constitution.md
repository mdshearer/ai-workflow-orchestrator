## Architecture

### Application Architecture
```
Pattern: [Monolith / Microservices / Serverless / Hybrid]
Why: [Reasoning for this choice]
```

**Example:**
```
Pattern: Monolithic Next.js application (for now)
Why: Faster development, easier deployment, sufficient for year 1-2 scale
Future: May split API into separate service at 10,000+ users

Deployment: Vercel (frontend + API routes)
Database: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL)
File Storage: Vercel Blob
Background Jobs: Inngest (for async tasks)
```

### Data Architecture
```
Primary Database: [Name and purpose]

Search: [Algolia / Elasticsearch / PostgreSQL full-text]
Real-time: [WebSockets / Server-Sent Events / Polling]
```

**Example:**
```
Primary DB: PostgreSQL (Supabase) for all app data
Read Replicas: No (not needed yet, Supabase handles this)
Analytics: BigQuery (export data daily for long-term analysis)
Search: PostgreSQL full-text search (pg_trgm) for now, Algolia if needed
Real-time: Server-Sent Events for dashboard updates
```

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
```
- Email/Password: [Minimum requirements]
- Password Policy: [Length, complexity, rotation]
- Session Management: [Duration, refresh strategy]
- Account Recovery: [Email / SMS / Security questions]
- Account Lockout: [After X failed attempts]
```

**Example:**
```
Auth via Clerk:
- Password: Minimum 12 characters, requires upper, lower, number, symbol
- Session: 7 days, sliding window (extends on activity)
- Recovery: Email-based password reset with 1-hour expiry
- Lockout: 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout
- Password Reuse: Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
```

### Authorization
```
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
- Roles: [List roles and what they can do]

```

**Example:**
```
Roles:
- Owner: Full access, billing, user management
- Admin: Full access except billing
- Editor: Create/edit/delete content
- Viewer: Read-only access

Multi-tenancy: Row-level security (RLS) in Supabase

Encryption in Transit: TLS 1.3 minimum
PII: Encrypted in database, never logged
Audit Logs: 90-day retention for compliance
Soft Delete: 30-day retention before hard delete (GDPR right to be forgotten)

- Anonymous: 100 req/hour per IP
- Webhooks: 10,000 req/hour

API Auth: Bearer tokens (JWT) with 1-hour expiry
CORS: Strict allow-list of customer domains
Input Validation: Zod schemas on all API inputs
SQL Injection: Prisma ORM (parameterized queries only)
XSS: React's built-in escaping + Content Security Policy
CSRF: SameSite=Strict cookies + CSRF tokens for mutations
```

---

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration
```
Strict Mode: [Yes / No]
No Implicit Any: [Yes / No]
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}
```

### File Structure
```

```

### Coding Conventions
```
Naming:
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx)
- Functions: camelCase (getUserData)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (API_BASE_URL)
- Types: PascalCase (User, UserProfile)

Comments:
- JSDoc for all public functions
- Inline comments for complex logic only
- TODO comments must include ticket number

Error Handling:
- Never swallow errors silently
- Log errors with context (user ID, request ID)
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Use custom error classes
```

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Fetches user profile data with caching
 * @param userId - The unique user identifier
 * @returns User profile object
 * @throws {UserNotFoundError} If user doesn't exist
 * @throws {DatabaseError} If database query fails
 */
async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
  try {
    const cached = await redis.get(`user:${userId}`);
    if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

    const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
    if (!user) throw new UserNotFoundError(userId);

    await redis.set(`user:${userId}`, JSON.stringify(user), 'EX', 3600);
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof UserNotFoundError) throw error;
    logger.error('Failed to fetch user profile', { userId, error });
    throw new DatabaseError('Failed to fetch user profile');
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```
Framework: [Vitest / Jest / etc.]
Coverage Target: [X%]
What to Test: [Business logic, utilities, helpers]
```

**Example:**
```
Framework: Vitest (fast, modern)
Coverage: 80% for src/lib/, 60% overall
Focus: Business logic, data transformations, utilities
Mock: External APIs, database calls
Run: Pre-commit hook + CI
```

### Integration Tests
```
Framework: [Playwright / Cypress / etc.]
What to Test: [API endpoints, critical user flows]
```

**Example:**
```
Framework: Playwright
Tests:
- API endpoints (all CRUD operations)
- Auth flows (signup, login, logout, password reset)
- Payment flows (subscription creation, cancellation)
- Data integrity (multi-tenant isolation)

Run: CI only (too slow for pre-commit)
```

### E2E Tests
```
Framework: [Playwright / Cypress]
Critical Paths: [List 3-5 critical user journeys]
```

**Example:**
```
Framework: Playwright
Critical Paths:
1. New user signup → onboarding → first dashboard view
2. Admin creates workspace → invites user → user accepts → accesses dashboard
3. User upgrades plan → enters payment → subscription active → features unlocked
4. User creates report → exports data → receives file

Run: Nightly + before prod deployments
```

### Manual QA Checklist
```
Before each release:
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test on mobile (iOS and Android)
- [ ] Test all payment flows in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify email notifications send correctly
- [ ] Check error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking works
```

## Questions for the AI

When building features, AI assistants should follow this Constitution and:

### Always:
- ✅ Reference CONSTITUTION.md in every prompt
- ✅ Write TypeScript with strict type safety
- ✅ Include comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- ✅ Implement proper authentication/authorization checks
- ✅ Validate all user inputs (Zod schemas)
- ✅ Write unit tests for business logic
- ✅ Follow security best practices (OWASP Top 10)
- ✅ Consider scalability (will this work at 10x scale?)
- ✅ Add proper logging and monitoring
- ✅ Mark sub-tasks complete [x] after finishing

### Never:
- ❌ Skip input validation or sanitization
- ❌ Hardcode secrets or API keys
- ❌ Expose internal errors to users
- ❌ Commit code without type safety
- ❌ Implement features in "Out of Scope"
- ❌ Skip authorization checks ("we'll add later")
- ❌ Use `any` type (use `unknown` if truly dynamic)
- ❌ Store passwords in plaintext
- ❌ Skip CSRF protection on mutations
- ❌ Implement without tests (for critical paths)

---

## Ready to Build!
