## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare
- [ ] Have your `CONSTITUTION.md` ready (brand voice, tone)
- [ ] Know your topic (even if rough)
- [ ] Understand your target audience
- [ ] Know your business goal (traffic, leads, etc.)

### Step 2: Fill Template Variables
- Replace `[CONTENT_TYPE]` → e.g., "Blog post", "Landing page"
- Replace `[TARGET_AUDIENCE]` → e.g., "B2B SaaS product managers at 10-100 person companies"
- Replace `[PRIMARY_GOAL]` → e.g., "Generate 2,000 monthly organic visits"
- Replace `[PRIMARY_KEYWORD]` → e.g., "project management software for small teams"
- Replace `[YOUR_TOPIC_DESCRIPTION]` → Your topic idea

### Step 3: Invoke AI & Answer Questions
The Content Strategist may ask:
- Who specifically is the target reader?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What makes this different from existing content?
- What action should readers take after reading?

Answer thoroughly to improve brief quality.

### Step 4: Review Generated Brief
Check:
- [ ] Angle is unique and compelling
- [ ] Audience is specific (not "everyone")
- [ ] Keywords are realistic (not too competitive)
- [ ] Outline serves the audience's needs
- [ ] CTA is clear and aligned with goals
- [ ] Aligns with CONSTITUTION.md brand voice

### Step 5: Save & Move to Draft
```bash
# Save brief
git add artifacts/01-content-brief.md
git commit -m "content: add brief for [topic]"
```

Next: Use [2.1-first-draft.md](../phase-2-creation/2.1-first-draft.md)

## Tips for Better Briefs

✅ **DO:**
- Define a specific target audience (not "business professionals")
- Identify a unique angle (what makes this different?)
- Choose realistic keywords (achievable competition level)
- Create a logical outline structure (serves reader's journey)
- Define clear success metrics

❌ **DON'T:**
- Target everyone ("general audience")
- Copy competitor outlines exactly
- Choose ultra-competitive keywords you can't rank for
- Skip the CTA (every piece needs a next step)
- Be vague about goals
