## Conversion Optimization

### Headline Testing
**Test these elements:**
- Benefit-focused vs feature-focused
- Question format vs statement
- Specific numbers vs general claims
- Urgency ("today", "now") vs no urgency

**Example:**
```
Version A: "Project Management Made Simple"
Version B: "Manage Your Team's Tasks in Under 5 Minutes a Day"
[B performed 32% better - specificity wins]
```

### CTA Best Practices

**Button Copy:**
- ✅ Action-oriented: "Start free trial", "Get started", "See demo"
- ✅ Benefit-focused: "Start saving time today"
- ✅ Remove friction: "No credit card required", "Free for 14 days"
- ❌ Generic: "Click here", "Submit", "Learn more"

**Button Placement:**
- Primary CTA: Above fold (hero section)
- Secondary CTA: After benefits section
- Final CTA: End of page

**Button Design:**
- High contrast color (stands out from page)
- Large enough to click easily (mobile-friendly)
- Whitespace around button (draws attention)

### Social Proof Strategy

**Types of Social Proof:**
1. **Customer testimonials:** Specific results, real names, photos
2. **Company logos:** "Trusted by..." (recognizable brands)
3. **Usage stats:** "10,000+ teams use [Product]"
4. **Case studies:** Detailed success stories with data
5. **Awards/badges:** Industry recognition, security certifications

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific: "Saved 10 hours/week" beats "Increased productivity"
- Use real names and photos: Builds trust
- Match to audience: B2B wants company names, B2C wants relatable individuals

## SEO for Marketing Content

### Landing Pages SEO
- **Primary keyword:** In headline, meta title, URL
- **Keyword density:** Less critical than conversion (don't stuff)
- **Meta description:** Compelling, includes keyword + CTA
- **URL structure:** /product-name or /landing-page-topic

### Balance SEO and Conversion
```
SEO-optimized headline: "Project Management Software for Small Teams"
Conversion-optimized headline: "Manage Your Team's Tasks in 5 Minutes a Day"

Solution: Use SEO headline for H1/meta title, conversion headline as visible hero text
```

---

## Constraints & Guidelines

### What We Don't Do
- ❌ False urgency: "Only 3 spots left!" (if untrue)
- ❌ Unrealistic claims: "10x your productivity" (unless provable)
- ❌ Hidden pricing: Always transparent about costs
- ❌ Clickbait: Don't over-promise and under-deliver
- ❌ Aggressive popups: Don't annoy visitors
- ❌ Dark patterns: No deceptive UI tricks

### Compliance Requirements
```
[Add any legal/compliance requirements]
Example:
- GDPR: Cookie consent, privacy policy link
- CAN-SPAM: Unsubscribe link in all emails
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Testimonials: Must have written permission
```

## A/B Testing Strategy

### What to Test
**High Impact:**
1. Headlines (biggest impact on conversion)
2. CTA button copy ("Start free trial" vs "Get started")
3. Hero image (product screenshot vs person using product)
4. Social proof placement (above vs below fold)

**Medium Impact:**
5. Benefit order (which benefits listed first)
6. Form length (how many fields to require)
7. Pricing display (monthly vs annual default)

**Low Impact:**
8. Button color (less important than copy)
9. Footer content
10. Font/styling tweaks

### Testing Process
1. **Hypothesis:** "Changing X will improve Y because Z"
2. **Test setup:** Create variant, 50/50 split traffic
3. **Run test:** Minimum 1,000 visitors or 2 weeks
4. **Analyze:** Statistical significance (>95% confidence)
5. **Implement winner:** Update production
6. **Document:** Log results for future reference
