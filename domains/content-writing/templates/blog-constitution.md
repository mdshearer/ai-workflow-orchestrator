## Project Overview

**Name:** [Your Blog Name]

**Purpose:** [One paragraph describing what your blog covers and who it serves]

**Example:**
```
Purpose: A B2B SaaS blog targeting product managers and startup founders.
We publish practical guides, tool comparisons, and workflow optimization tips
to help small teams work more efficiently.
```

---

## Core Principles

**Remember:** These principles guide all content decisions:

1. **Reader value first** - Every piece must solve a real problem or answer a real question
2. **Quality over quantity** - Better to publish 2 great articles than 10 mediocre ones
3. **Authenticity** - Write from experience, not generic advice
4. **SEO-informed, not SEO-obsessed** - Optimize for search but write for humans
5. **Transparent iteration** - Update content as information changes

---

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Overall Voice

**Define your baseline voice:**
```
Example: Conversational professional - approachable but credible
- Use "you" (second person)
- Write like talking to a colleague
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Use contractions (you're, don't, we'll)
```

### Intensity Level: [SET YOUR RANGE]

Your content intensity should be **3-6/10** (measured, confident without hype).

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1-2 | Too understated | "This might possibly help somewhat" |
| **3-6** | **Target range** | "This approach significantly reduces manual work" |
| 7-10 | Too intense | "This REVOLUTIONARY method will TRANSFORM everything!" |

**Forbidden intensity words (7+/10):**
- obsessed, brutal, massive, revolutionary, crushing it
- game-changing, mind-blowing, insane, disrupt

**Acceptable intensity words (3-6/10):**
- great, significant, important, valuable, effective, useful

**Preferred (measured emphasis):**
- notably, particularly, consistently, reliably, meaningfully

### Four Voice Dimensions

Based on Nielsen Norman Group framework - rate your brand voice:

**1. Funny vs. Serious: [SET 1-5]**
```
Example: 4/5 (Mostly Serious)
- Dry, observational wit permitted
- No puns or forced wordplay
- Self-deprecating humor sparingly
```

**2. Formal vs. Casual: [SET 1-5]**
```
Example: 3/5 (Conversational Professional)
- Use contractions
- Write as peer, not professor
- No slang or internet abbreviations
```

**3. Respectful vs. Irreverent: [SET 1-5]**
```
Example: 2/5 (Respectful/Direct)
- Treat reader as expert
- Don't over-explain basics
- Be direct without arrogance
```

**4. Enthusiastic vs. Matter-of-Fact: [SET 1-5]**
```
Example: 5/5 (Matter-of-Fact)
- Show, don't tell
- "Reduces latency by 50ms" not "exciting performance gains"
- Let results speak
```

### Tone Variations by Content Type
```
How-to guides: Helpful, patient, step-by-step
Thought leadership: Confident, insightful, forward-thinking
Product comparisons: Objective, balanced, data-driven
Case studies: Story-driven, specific, results-focused
```
