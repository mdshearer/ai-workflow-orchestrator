## Core Principles

**Remember:** These principles guide all content decisions:

1. **Reader value first** - Every piece must solve a real problem or answer a real question
2. **Quality over quantity** - Better to publish 2 great articles than 10 mediocre ones
3. **Authenticity** - Write from experience, not generic advice
4. **SEO-informed, not SEO-obsessed** - Optimize for search but write for humans
5. **Transparent iteration** - Update content as information changes
