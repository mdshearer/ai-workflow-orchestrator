# Workflow Decision Tree: Choosing the Right Content Writing Workflow

**Choose the right workflow for your content based on complexity, length, and research needs.**

---

## Quick Decision: 3 Questions

Answer these 3 questions to find your workflow:

### Question 1: How long is the content?

- **Under 400 words** → Go to Question 2 (likely **Simple Workflow**)
- **400-1500 words** → Go to Question 3 (likely **Quick Workflow**)
- **Over 1500 words** → Go to Question 3 (likely **Full Workflow**)

### Question 2: For short content (< 400 words)

**Does it need a complex structure with multiple distinct sections?**

- **No** (single idea, simple flow) → **[Simple Workflow](#simple-workflow-3-personas)** ✅
- **Yes** (multiple points, needs planning) → Go to Question 3

### Question 3: For all other content

**Do you need external research (statistics, quotes, citations)?**

- **Yes** (industry data, competitor analysis, third-party stats) → **[Full Workflow](#full-workflow-5-personas)** ✅
- **No** (writing from expertise, internal knowledge) → **[Quick Workflow](#quick-workflow-4-personas)** ✅

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario: Started Simple, realized it needs structure

**Situation:** 30 minutes into Simple Workflow and realize you need the Content Architect.

**Solution:**
1. Pause current workflow
2. Create article skeleton using Content Architect persona
3. Resume with Content Writer using the skeleton
4. You've upgraded to Quick Workflow mid-process

**Time cost:** +30-45 min (better than rewriting disorganized prose later)

---

### Scenario: Started Quick, realized you need research

**Situation:** Content Architect reveals you need external data you don't have.

**Solution:**
1. Pause before Content Writer
2. Run Fact Checker persona to gather research
3. Re-run Content Architect with research dossier included
4. Continue with Full Workflow

**Time cost:** +60-90 min (necessary for quality and credibility)

---

### Scenario: Tight deadline

**Situation:** Content needed in 2 hours, normally would use Full Workflow.

**Options:**

**Option A: Downgrade quality, meet deadline**
- Use Quick Workflow (skip research)
- Accept limitations (no external stats)
- Add disclaimer: "Based on our experience"
- **Risk:** Less credible, no data backing

**Option B: Reduce scope**
- Cut word count (2000 → 1000)
- Use Quick Workflow
- Plan follow-up piece with Full Workflow
- **Risk:** Less comprehensive coverage

**Option C: Extend deadline**
- Communicate research needs time
- Use Full Workflow properly
- Deliver higher quality
- **Risk:** Miss original deadline

**Recommendation:** Option B (reduce scope) maintains quality while meeting timeline

---

### Scenario: High-volume content production

**Situation:** Need to create 10 pieces of similar content this month.

**Approach:**
1. Use appropriate workflow for content type (likely Quick for most)
2. Create strategy brief ONCE for the series (reuse)
3. Create Content Architect skeleton ONCE as template (customize per piece)
4. Batch Content Writer runs (write 3 at a time)
5. Batch Editor runs

**Time savings:**
- 10 separate briefs: 200 min → Reused brief: 20 min
- 10 separate skeletons: 450 min → Template-based: 150 min
- **Total saved:** ~8 hours for 10-piece series

---

## Workflow Upgrade/Downgrade Rules

### Can You Upgrade Mid-Workflow?

✅ **YES** - You can always add personas:
- Simple → Quick: Add Content Architect before writing
- Quick → Full: Add Fact Checker before Architect
- Simple → Full: Add both Fact Checker and Architect

**Just pause, run the missing persona, then resume.**

### Can You Downgrade Mid-Workflow?

❌ **NO (with exceptions)**:
- Once you've run Fact Checker (research exists), use it—don't ignore the data
- Once you've run Content Architect (skeleton exists), follow it—don't abandon structure

**Exception:** If research reveals the topic isn't viable, you can abandon entirely.

## Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs

| Workflow | Time | Quality | When to Compromise |
|----------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Full** | 3-5 hrs | Highest (researched, structured, verified) | Never - if you need research, you need it |
| **Quick** | 2-3 hrs | High (structured, expertise-based) | Acceptable for internal content |
| **Simple** | 1-2 hrs | Good (voice-controlled, focused) | Fine for social media |

**Golden Rule:** Never skip Editor—it's the final quality gate. Always validate voice, facts, and constitutional alignment.

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I skip Content Architect to save time?

**A:** You can for simple content (<400 words, obvious structure). For anything else, skipping Architect is a false economy:
- Skipping saves: 30-45 min
- Risk: Disorganized content → 2-3 hours of rewriting
- **Verdict:** Only skip for truly simple content

### Q: Can I skip Editor?

**A:** No. Editor is the quality gate that catches:
- Constitutional violations (Kill List words, wrong intensity)
- Voice inconsistencies
- Missing CTAs
- Unsourced claims (hallucinations)

Time saved: 15-20 min
Risk: Publishing poor-quality content that damages brand

**Never skip Editor.**

### Q: Can I use Full Workflow for short content?

**A:** Yes, but inefficient. If you have research for a 300-word post, use it. But Full Workflow for 150 words is over-engineering.

Better: Use research informally in Quick/Simple workflow, cite sources casually.

### Q: What if I'm unsure which workflow to use?

**A:** Start with the longer workflow. It's easier to skip personas you don't need than to add them mid-process.

**Rule of thumb:**
- If debating Simple vs. Quick → Choose **Quick**
- If debating Quick vs. Full → Choose **Full**
- You can always go faster next time

**After choosing your workflow:**

1. **Create project folder** in your workspace
2. **Copy appropriate constitution template** (blog, marketing, or technical)
3. **Follow workflow sequence:**
   - [Simple: 3 personas](./workflow-overview.md#simple-workflow)
   - [Quick: 4 personas](./workflow-overview.md#quick-workflow)
   - [Full: 5 personas](./workflow-overview.md#full-workflow)
4. **Track time** to improve estimates for future content
5. **Note what works** for your content type
